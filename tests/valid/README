Valid Whiley Tests
==================

The valid tests are all examples of valid whiley programs.  None of
these tests should be rejected by the compiler.  All should generate
some amount of output, which can be used to ensure correct
compilation.  They split into two sub-directories:

definite --- these are examples which may (or may not) require wyone
to prove correct.  The examples in this category can all be proved as
definitely correct by wyone.  Observe that every test case must
generate some form of runtime output.  This means the tests serve two
purposes: firstly, to test wyone; secondly, to test the compiled
whiley code generates the expected output.

unknown --- these are examples which wyone is unable to definitely
identify as being correct.  Therefore, when compiled, these examples
will include one or more runtime checks.  As before, every test case
must generate some form of runtime output.
