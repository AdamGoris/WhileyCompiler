Invalid Whiley Tests
====================

The invalid tests are all examples of invalid whiley programs.
Therefore, the compiler should reject them.  They split into three
sub-directies:

simple --- these are simple kinds of errors which can be caught
without using wyone at all.  This class includes all errors caught by
the type checker, and also constraint errors which are identified
through the expression reduction process.

definite --- these are more complex errors, which require wyone to
identify.  The errors in this category can all be definitely
determined as errors by wyone.  Observe that every error in these
tests must be observable at runtime.  This means the tests can serve
two purposes: firstly, to test wyone; secondly, to test appropriate
runtime checks are generated.

unknown --- these are also complex errors, which require wyone to be
called.  However, in this case, wyone is unable to definitely identify
them --- meaning it is uncertain about whether they are real errors or
not.  Therefore, these errors will definitely be converted into
runtime checks.  As before, every error in these tests must be
observable at runtime.  This means they can be used to test
appropriate runtime checks are generated.
