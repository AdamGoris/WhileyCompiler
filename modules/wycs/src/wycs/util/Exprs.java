 * More specifically, the supported data types are:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Records.</b> These are maps from fixed field names to values of
 * heterogenous type. They are encoded as sets of tuples which implement
 * <code>wycs.lang.Map</code> and where fields are represented as strings
 * mapping to their contents.</li>
 * <li><b>Lists.</b></li>
 * <li><b>Maps.</b></li>
 * <li><b>Strings.</b></li>
