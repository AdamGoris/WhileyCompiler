Whiley Development Kit (WDK)
============================
Author: David J. Pearce, June 2010

Welcome to the Whiley Development Kit.  This will allow you compile
and run Whiley programs on the Java Virtual Machine.  Whiley will
operate on any system that can run Java including Windows, Mac OS and
Linux.  Whiley is released under the GNU General Public License,
version 3 --- see the LICENSE file for more on this.

Finally, to learn more about the Whiley language, visit
http://whiley.org.  There you will find a range of documentation,
including an overview of the aims and objectives of Whiley, and an
introduction into the syntax of the language.

Installation
============

To install the Whiley Development Kit, unpack the tarball into an
appropriate directory (as you've probably already done).  You then
need to make sure that PATH environment variable points to the bin/
directory, where several scripts are provided for running Whiley.
(don't worry if you don't know what the PATH is, as you can instead
run the jar directly --- see below).

With the PATH setup correctly, you should be able to run the wyjc
command to compile Whiley programs as follows:

% cd examples
% wyjc hello-world.whiley

At this point, you can run the program using the whiley command:

% whiley hello-world
Hello World

(note: the whiley command is just a wrapper for java -cp
lib/wyrt.jar).

Running the Jar Directly
========================

If you're running on a Windows system without cygwin, or you're having
trouble getting the wyjc scripts to work, then a useful alternative is
to run the jar file directly.  You can do this as follows:

% cd examples
% java -jar ../lib/wyjc.jar -bp ../lib/wyrt.jar hello-world.whiley

Then, to run the program you would do this:

% java -cp "../lib/wyrt.jar;." hello-world
Hello World

(note: under UNIX you will want to replace the ';' with a ':')

Getting Help
============

If you have trouble getting Whiley to work properly, first consult the
whiley.org website.  If you are unable to find a solution, you can
