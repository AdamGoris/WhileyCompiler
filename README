Introduction
======================================================================

Whiley is a programming language particularly suited to
safety-critical systems. It is a hybrid object-oriented and functional
programming language which employs extended static checking to
eliminate errors at compile time, including divide-by-zero, array
out-of-bounds and null dereference errors.  Whiley compiles to the
Java Virtual Machine and is fully inter-operable with existing Java
applications.

Whiley will operate on any system that can run Java including Windows,
Mac OS and Linux.  Whiley is released under the New BSD License ---
see the LICENSE file for more on this.

Installation
======================================================================

There are several different ways you can get going with Whiley:

1) Installing the Eclipse Plugin

2) Downloading the Whiley Development Kit.

3) Running an executable Jar file directly

The Eclipse plugin is the easiest way to install and run Whiley
programs (see below for instructions).  However, if you don't use
Eclipse or would like to work with the source directly, then download
and install the development kit (see below).  Finally, you can also
run the compiler directly as an executable Jar.

Eclipse Plugin
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the Whiley Eclipse plugin (wyclipse) start Eclipse and
select "Install New Software" (normally found under "Help").  Then,
enter the Whiley Software Site (http://whiley.org/eclipse), and you
should find the "Whiley Eclipse Plugin" becomes an option to install.
At this point, "select all" and follow the instructions to install the
plugin.

For more info on Wyclipse, see http://whiley.org/tools/wyclipse/

Whiley Development Kit (WDK)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the Whiley Development Kit, first download it from
http://whiley.org/downloads.  Then, unpack the tarball into an
appropriate directory (as you've probably already done).  You then
need to make sure that PATH environment variable points to the bin/
directory, where several scripts are provided for running Whiley.
(don't worry if you don't know what the PATH is, as you can instead
run the jar directly --- see below).

With the PATH setup correctly, you should be able to run the wyjc
command to compile Whiley programs as follows:

% cd examples
% wyjc hello-world.whiley

At this point, you can run the program using the whiley command:

% wyj hello-world
Hello World

(note: the wyj command is just a wrapper for java -cp lib/wyrt.jar).

Executable Jar
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you're running on a Windows system without cygwin, or you're having
trouble getting the wyjc scripts to work, then a useful alternative is
to run the jar file directly.  You can do this as follows:

% cd examples
% java -jar ../lib/wyjc-vX.Y.Z.jar -bp ../lib/wyrt-vX.Y.Z.jar hello-world.whiley

(here, vX.Y.Z is the version number of the distribution)

Then, to run the program you would do this:

% java -cp "../lib/wyrt-vX.Y.Z.jar;." hello-world
Hello World

(note: under UNIX you will want to replace the ';' with a ':')
