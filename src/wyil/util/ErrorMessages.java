 * Contains global constants mapping syntax errors to their error messages. The

 * that:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>It's easy to change error messages, and be sure the changes are applied
 * universally.</li>
 * <li>It's easy to reflect on the set of all error messages, and perhaps find
 * ways to improve them.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * In short, error message reporting is done poorly by modern compilers and it
 * would be nice to do a better job!
