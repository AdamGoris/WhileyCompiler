/**
 * Responsible for resolving a name which occurs at some position in a
 * compilation unit. This takes into account the context and, if necessary, will
 * traverse important statements to resolve the query. For example, consider a
 * compilation unit entitled "file":
 *
 * <pre>
 * import std::ascii::*
 *
 * function f(T1 x, T2 y) -> (int r):
 *    return g(x,y)
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here the name "<code>g</code>" is not fully qualified. Depending on which
 * file the matching declaration of <code>g</code> occurs will depend on what
 * its fully qualified name is. For example, if <code>g</code> is declared in
 * the current compilation unit then it's fully quaified name would be
 * <code>test.g</code>. However, it could well be declared in a compilation unit
 * matching the import <code>whiley.lang.*</code>.
